					<h2>Project Protect Himalayas</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>Chamoli,Uttarakhand, Himalayas - India<br>
						<strong>Species Planted: </strong>Orange, Amla, Peach<br>

					<h2>Project Enrich Biodiversity</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>Takari village, Walva Taluka, Sangli, Maharashtra, India<br>
						<strong>Species Planted: </strong>Mango, Guava, Gulmohar, Neem<br>
						<strong>Environmental and Social Impact: </strong>The village has more than 80% of the total population which lives under the poverty line. There are no employment opportunities other than farming available for poor youth and therefore they opt to move to cities in search of employment. The village is located on the banks of river Krishna and there is a tremendous potential to extend livelihood option to villagers and promote biodiversity through development of a sustainable plantation program.
						Impressed with the active participation from village panchayat and local communities, Go Green Organiztion has taken a pledge to sponsor villagers for orchards full of fruit bearing trees. Moreover ample of irrigation facilities will also help in sustenance of planted trees and we believe that grown up trees will become source of income for the poor farmers.

					<h2>Project Green Leh Ladakh</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>Village Stakna, Leh Ladakh, India.<br>
						<strong>Species Planted: </strong>Willows (Salix), Poplar<br>
						<strong>Environmental and Social Impact: </strong>Go Green Organization has initiated a green campaign in the most difficult terrain in the cold arid desert of Ladakh and is dedicated to the sustainable development of the region. 
						Amidst of inclement weather conditions, with support from local communities we are working towards developing thick forests in this arid region to help check soil erosion and preserve environment.

					<h2>Project Green Thar</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Location: </strong>Village Bhata,Harsani,Paadru,Chokhla District-Barmer and Raajmathai District- Jaisalmer , Thar Desert, Rajasthan,India<br>
						<strong>Species Planted: </strong>Pomegranate, Ber, Neem.<br>
						<strong>Environmental and Social Impact: </strong>In pursuit of creating forest in middle of Thar Desert, Go Green Organiztion is developing pomegranate and other fruit bearing trees orchards for the farmers in these villages. While the entire area lacks tree cover, we have taken up a challenge to grow fruit bearing trees to directly benefit poor villagers who have limited livelihood options. The planted trees will also provide fodder to livestock which currently struggles in lack of vegetation. We have also adopted few government schools to make their campuses greener through tree plantation. Best performing schools are rewarded with funds from our end, therefore in addition to creating environmental impact we are also supporting cause of education through this plantation site.
